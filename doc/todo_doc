- Diagram from IDEA

- Write a report on the assignment, as a document in PDF format.
- The title page of the document must show appropriate identifications:
    - the name of the student
    - the name of the course
    - the name of the project
    - and the valid date and time of delivery.

Describe the overall architecture of your language processor with, e.g.,
    - UML diagrams.
    - Explain your diagrams.
    - Clearly describe yout testing, and the design of test data.
    - Tell about possible shortcomings of your program
        (if well documented they might be partly forgiven).
    - Give instructions how to build and run your interpreter.

The report must include the following parts
    - The Mini-PL token patterns as regular expressions or, alternatively, as regular definitions.
    - A modified context-free grammar suitable for recursive-descent parsing
        (eliminating any LL(1) violations);
    - Specify abstract syntax trees (AST), i.e., the internal representation for Mini-PL programs;
        you can use UML diagrams or alternatively give a syntax-based definition of the abstract syntax.
    - Error handling approach and solutions used in your Mini-PL implementation
        (in its scanner, parser, semantic analyzer, and interpreter).
    - For completeness, include the original project definition and the
        Mini-PL specification as appendices of your document;
        you can refer to them when explaining your solutions.
